# BIS Standards Revision Project (2025 Drafts) üõ†Ô∏èüáÆüá≥

[cite_start]This repository contains the revised drafts for three critical Indian Standards (IS) documents developed in alignment with modern industry practices and international standards (like ISO)[cite: 177, 347, 933]. [cite_start]These drafts were created as part of a revision project, modernizing specifications like IS 715:2002 [cite: 576][cite_start], IS 3874:1987 [cite: 30][cite_start], and IS 6479:1972[cite: 514].

## 1. Coated Abrasives - Specification (Draft 2025)

[cite_start]This revision covers specifications for flexible abrasive products (belts, discs, and sheets) used for material removal, finishing, and polishing[cite: 958]. [cite_start]It modernizes the standards by incorporating new materials and rigorous performance tests[cite: 951].

### Key Technical Updates

* [cite_start]**Materials & Backings:** Abrasive grains include Aluminum oxide, Silicon Carbide, Ceramic Alumina, and Diamond[cite: 978]. [cite_start]Backing materials include Paper, Cloth, Nonwoven, and Film (Polyester or PVC)[cite: 982, 984, 985, 986].
* [cite_start]**Dimensional Requirement:** The finished product tensile strength requirements are detailed by backing type[cite: 1033, 1034]:
    * [cite_start]Cloth-backed products must withstand at least $\mathbf{500}$ N per 15 mm width[cite: 1034, 1074].
    * [cite_start]Paper-backed products must withstand at least $\mathbf{200}$ N per 15 mm width[cite: 1033, 1074].
* **Performance Tests:** Mandatory tests and criteria are established:
    * [cite_start]**Abrasion Resistance Test:** No breakthrough or wear-through of the backing material, with weight loss less than $15$ mg after $1,000$ cycles (for Fine grade, $\mathbf{1000}$ cycles required)[cite: 1040, 1041, 1074].
    * [cite_start]**Cut-Rate Test:** Must remove at least $\mathbf{0.10} \text{ g/cm}^{2}\text{ min}$ of material (for Fine grade)[cite: 1052, 1074].
    * [cite_start]**VOC Emissions Test:** The sample must emit less than $\mathbf{5} \text{ mg/m}^{3}$ of VOCs[cite: 1062, 1075].
* [cite_start]**Quality Assurance:** Sampling is based on ISO 2859-1[cite: 969, 1023].

## 2. Boxing Gloves - Specification (Draft 2025)

[cite_start]This standard prescribes modern requirements for boxing gloves intended for training, sparring, and competitive boxing, replacing the older IS 3874:1987 standard which used horse hair and coarse cotton padding[cite: 76, 45, 50, 203].

### Key Classifications and Requirements

* [cite_start]**Classification by Weight and Use**[cite: 211]:
    * [cite_start]**Training Gloves (Level 2):** Typically $12‚Äì18$ oz ($\mathbf{340‚Äì510}$ g)[cite: 213, 332].
    * [cite_start]**Sparring Gloves (Level 2):** Typically $14‚Äì16$ oz ($\mathbf{397‚Äì454}$ g)[cite: 216].
    * [cite_start]**Professional Competition Gloves (Level 1):** Typically $8$ oz ($\approx 227$ g) or $10$ oz ($\approx 283$ g)[cite: 217, 332].
* [cite_start]**Materials:** Padding shall be modern **Multilayer Foam** or **Molded Foam** [cite: 230, 232][cite_start], moving away from the older requirement for horse hair and coarse cotton[cite: 45, 50]. [cite_start]The outer shell is made of Natural Leather or Synthetic Leather (PU, PVC, or Microfiber)[cite: 225, 226].
* [cite_start]**Stitching:** All stitching must use high-tensile polyester or polyamide core-spun thread[cite: 238].
* [cite_start]**Performance Test - Seam Strength:** Requires tensile testing on major seams to withstand a load of up to **200 N** without rupture, per ISO 13935-2:2014[cite: 302, 304].
* [cite_start]**Safety Tests:** The inner lining and shell materials must pass a pH test, with the value required to be between $\mathbf{3.5}$ and $\mathbf{9.5}$[cite: 235, 322].

## 3. Punching Balls - Specification (Draft 2025)

[cite_start]This standard updates and unifies requirements for various punching balls, including the **Speed Ball** and **Double-End Ball**, superseding IS 6479:1972[cite: 364, 372].

### Key Performance and Material Requirements

* [cite_start]**Ball Types:** Covers **Speed Balls** (for hand speed/timing) and **Double-End Balls** (for reflex/precision)[cite: 375, 376, 399, 400].
* [cite_start]**Outer Shell Construction:** Must be made of tough, abrasion-resistant material (full-grain cowhide/buffalo leather or synthetic fabric)[cite: 407, 408].
* [cite_start]**Stitch Density:** Stitching must be dense enough, with at least **24‚Äì28 stitches per 10 cm**[cite: 415].
* **Speed Ball Hardware:** Specifies the critical Ball and Socket Joint features:
    * [cite_start]Socket: Hardened iron piece with a $\mathbf{27}$ mm seating diameter[cite: 386].
    * [cite_start]Ball: Hardened iron sphere with a $\mathbf{30.16}$ mm diameter[cite: 387, 536].
* **Performance Testing:**
    * [cite_start]**Air Retention Test:** For inflatable balls, pressure loss must be $\mathbf{\le 5\%}$ of initial pressure over 24 hours[cite: 453].
    * [cite_start]**Abrasion Resistance Test:** No through-wear or rupture after $\mathbf{10,000}$ cycles[cite: 457].
    * [cite_start]**Impact/Durability Test:** No visible damage after $\mathbf{100}$ consecutive impacts[cite: 444].
    * [cite_start]**Chemical Safety:** Leather pH must be between $\mathbf{3.5}$ and $\mathbf{7.0}$ [cite: 460][cite_start], and materials must meet limits for Azo dyes and Chromium (VI)[cite: 461, 462].
