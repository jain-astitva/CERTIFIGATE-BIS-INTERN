This repository contains the revised drafts for three critical Indian Standards (IS) documents developed in alignment with modern industry practices and international standards (like ISO). These drafts were created as part of a revision project, modernizing specifications for Coated Abrasives, Boxing Gloves, and Punching Balls.

## 1. Coated Abrasives - Specification (Draft 2025)

This revision covers specifications for flexible abrasive products (belts, discs, and sheets) used for material removal, finishing, and polishing.

### Key Technical Updates

* **Materials & Backings:** Abrasive grains include Aluminum oxide, Silicon Carbide, Ceramic Alumina, and Diamond. Backing materials include Paper, Cloth, Nonwoven, and Film (Polyester or PVC).
* **Dimensional Requirement:** The finished product tensile strength requirements are detailed by backing type:
    * Cloth-backed products must withstand at least $\mathbf{500}$ N per 15 mm width.
    * Paper-backed products must withstand at least $\mathbf{200}$ N per 15 mm width.
* **Performance Tests:** Mandatory tests and criteria are established:
    * **Abrasion Resistance Test:** No breakthrough or wear-through of the backing material, with weight loss less than $15$ mg after $1,000$ cycles (for Fine grade, $\mathbf{1000}$ cycles required).
    * **Cut-Rate Test:** Must remove at least $\mathbf{0.10} \text{ g/cm}^{2}\text{ min}$ of material (for Fine grade).
    * **VOC Emissions Test:** The sample must emit less than $\mathbf{5} \text{ mg/m}^{3}$ of VOCs.
* **Quality Assurance:** Sampling is based on ISO 2859-1.

## 2. Boxing Gloves - Specification (Draft 2025)

This standard prescribes modern requirements for boxing gloves intended for training, sparring, and competitive boxing, replacing the older standard which used horse hair and coarse cotton padding.

### Key Classifications and Requirements

* **Classification by Weight and Use**:
    * **Training Gloves (Level 2):** Typically $12–18$ oz ($\mathbf{340–510}$ g).
    * **Sparring Gloves (Level 2):** Typically $14–16$ oz ($\mathbf{397–454}$ g).
    * **Professional Competition Gloves (Level 1):** Typically $8$ oz ($\approx 227$ g) or $10$ oz ($\approx 283$ g).
* **Materials:** Padding shall be modern **Multilayer Foam** or **Molded Foam**. The outer shell is made of Natural Leather or Synthetic Leather.
* **Stitching:** All stitching must use high-tensile polyester or polyamide core-spun thread.
* **Performance Test - Seam Strength:** Requires tensile testing on major seams to withstand a load of up to **200 N** without rupture, per ISO 13935-2:2014.
* **Safety Tests:** The inner lining and shell materials must pass a pH test, with the value required to be between $\mathbf{3.5}$ and $\mathbf{9.5}$.

## 3. Punching Balls - Specification (Draft 2025)

This standard updates and unifies requirements for various punching balls, including the **Speed Ball** and **Double-End Ball**.

### Key Performance and Material Requirements

* **Ball Types:** Covers **Speed Balls** (for hand speed/timing) and **Double-End Balls** (for reflex/precision).
* **Outer Shell Construction:** Must be made of tough, abrasion-resistant material (full-grain cowhide/buffalo leather or synthetic fabric).
* **Stitch Density:** Stitching must be dense enough, with at least **24–28 stitches per 10 cm**.
* **Speed Ball Hardware:** Specifies the critical Ball and Socket Joint features:
    * Socket: Hardened iron piece with a $\mathbf{27}$ mm seating diameter.
    * Ball: Hardened iron sphere with a $\mathbf{30.16}$ mm diameter.
* **Performance Testing:**
    * **Air Retention Test:** For inflatable balls, pressure loss must be $\mathbf{\le 5\%}$ of initial pressure over 24 hours.
    * **Abrasion Resistance Test:** No through-wear or rupture after $\mathbf{10,000}$ cycles.
    * **Impact/Durability Test:** No visible damage after $\mathbf{100}$ consecutive impacts.
    * **Chemical Safety:** Leather pH must be between $\mathbf{3.5}$ and $\mathbf{7.0}$, and materials must meet limits for Azo dyes and Chromium (VI).
