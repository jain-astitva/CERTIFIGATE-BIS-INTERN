These drafts were created as part of a revision project, modernizing specifications like IS 715:2002 2, IS 3874:1987 3, and IS 6479:19724.1. Coated Abrasives - Specification (Draft 2025)This revision covers specifications for flexible abrasive products (belts, discs, and sheets) used for material removal, finishing, and polishing5. It modernizes the standards by incorporating new materials and rigorous performance tests6.Key Technical UpdatesMaterials & Backings: Abrasive grains include Aluminum oxide, Silicon Carbide, Ceramic Alumina, and Diamond7. Backing materials include Paper, Cloth, Nonwoven, and Film (Polyester or PVC)8888.Dimensional Requirement: The finished product tensile strength requirements are detailed by backing type9:Cloth-backed products must withstand at least $\mathbf{500}$ N per 15 mm width10101010.Paper-backed products must withstand at least $\mathbf{200}$ N per 15 mm width11111111.Performance Tests: Mandatory tests and criteria are established:Abrasion Resistance Test: No breakthrough or wear-through of the backing material, with weight loss less than $15$ mg after $1,000$ cycles (for Fine grade, $\mathbf{1000}$ cycles required)12121212.Cut-Rate Test: Must remove at least $\mathbf{0.10} \text{ g/cm}^{2}\text{ min}$ of material (for Fine grade)13131313.VOC Emissions Test: The sample must emit less than $\mathbf{5} \text{ mg/m}^{3}$ of VOCs14141414.Quality Assurance: Sampling is based on ISO 2859-115151515.2. Boxing Gloves - Specification (Draft 2025)This standard prescribes modern requirements for boxing gloves intended for training, sparring, and competitive boxing, replacing the older IS 3874:1987 standard which used horse hair and coarse cotton padding161616161616161616161616.Key Classifications and RequirementsClassification by Weight and Use17:Training Gloves (Level 2): Typically $12‚Äì18$ oz ($\mathbf{340‚Äì510}$ g)18181818.Sparring Gloves (Level 2): Typically $14‚Äì16$ oz ($\mathbf{397‚Äì454}$ g)19.Professional Competition Gloves (Level 1): Typically $8$ oz ($\approx 227$ g) or $10$ oz ($\approx 283$ g)20202020.Materials: Padding shall be modern Multilayer Foam or Molded Foam 21212121, moving away from the older requirement for horse hair and coarse cotton22222222. The outer shell is made of Natural Leather or Synthetic Leather (PU, PVC, or Microfiber)23.Stitching: All stitching must use high-tensile polyester or polyamide core-spun thread24.Performance Test - Seam Strength: Requires tensile testing on major seams to withstand a load of up to 200 N without rupture, per ISO 13935-2:201425252525.Safety Tests: The inner lining and shell materials must pass a pH test, with the value required to be between $\mathbf{3.5}$ and $\mathbf{9.5}$26262626.3. Punching Balls - Specification (Draft 2025)This standard updates and unifies requirements for various punching balls, including the Speed Ball and Double-End Ball, superseding IS 6479:197227272727.Key Performance and Material RequirementsBall Types: Covers Speed Balls (for hand speed/timing) and Double-End Balls (for reflex/precision)28282828.Outer Shell Construction: Must be made of tough, abrasion-resistant material (full-grain cowhide/buffalo leather or synthetic fabric)29.Stitch Density: Stitching must be dense enough, with at least 24‚Äì28 stitches per 10 cm30.Speed Ball Hardware: Specifies the critical Ball and Socket Joint features:Socket: Hardened iron piece with a $\mathbf{27}$ mm seating diameter31.Ball: Hardened iron sphere with a $\mathbf{30.16}$ mm diameter32323232.Performance Testing:Air Retention Test: For inflatable balls, pressure loss must be $\mathbf{\le 5\%}$ of initial pressure over 24 hours33.Abrasion Resistance Test: No through-wear or rupture after $\mathbf{10,000}$ cycles34.Impact/Durability Test: No visible damage after $\mathbf{100}$ consecutive impacts35.Chemical Safety: Leather pH must be between $\mathbf{3.5}$ and $\mathbf{7.0}$ 36, and materials must meet limits for Azo dyes and Chromium (VI)37.
